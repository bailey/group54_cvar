# ARCore + Sceneform for Image Recognition + Rendering of AR Elements

This draft project demonstrates my first attempt at AR Android development. The project consists of recognizing an image, and then rendering an AR pin atop the recognized image based on static coordinates. This repo was used as a testing environment.
